# Port-Scanner
I have developed a basic port scanner using Python to explore the functionality of the nmap tool. This tool allows users to scan for open ports on a given host or range of hosts. While it doesn't incorporate advanced scanning techniques, it serves as a starting point for understanding port scanning concepts and utilizing the nmap library.
